TEXTDATA = Chainline is the distance between the centerline of your frame and the average centerline of your chainring(s).  For 1X this is easy – If the center of your chainring teeth is 49mm from the centerline of your frame then your chainline is 49mm.  It gets slightly more difficult if you have multiple front chainrings.  A 2X crank with tooth centerlines that are located at 45mm (smaller ring) and 53mm (larger ring) would have a 49mm 2X chainline.  Unfortunately, if you were to remove these rings and install a standard narrow-wide ring the resulting 1X chainline would be about 52mm. This is 3mm wider than the ideal 49mm 1X chainline but makes up the vast majority of all 1X conversions. At OneUp Components we're 100% focused on 1X drivetrains.  Below is a detailed guide to help you get perfect chainline.
